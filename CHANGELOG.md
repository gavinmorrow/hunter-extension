# Changelog

## v0.3.1

_released 28 February 2025_

- Features:
  - Add a button to open the changelog (this document) to the toolbar.
- Bug Fixes:
  - Fix the colors of some classes not displaying.

## v0.3.0

_released 23 February 2025_

(I decided to bump to v0.3 b/c I did a lot of work on the assignments loading
and it felt like it deserved a minor release and not a patch release.)

- Bug Fixes/Improvements:
  - Fix performance of loading assignments. This required a complete overhaul
    of the assignment loading system, so if there are any bugs please tell me!
  - Past assignments show up again!
  - Prevent the window from jittering up and down rapidly.
  - Calculate the header size from a different source so it is always correct.
  - Adjust the header spacer on window resize so it always remains correct.
  - Increase the timeout for google autologin, so it hopefully won't get stuck
    in a loop. (From 0.5sec -> 1sec. It shouldn't be very noticeable.)
- Known problems:
  - The colors of some classes are missing. This is because for some reason
    they're not included in the API response. I have a plan to fix it, I just
    don't want to delay this release any further.

## v0.2.10

_released 03 February 2025_

- **IMPORTANT:**
  - Performance of Blackbaud has gotten really bad, and the solution isn't done
    yet. In the meantime, **_past assignments will not be displayed._**
- Improvements:
  - Make action buttons (eg `Mark as Completed`) stretch horizontally to fill.
  - Make buttons and input fields inside of the custom UI dark themed.
  - Show attached links in the attachments section in the assignment popup.

- Features:
  - Downloads/attachments are shown in the assignment popup.
  - The name of the class is shown at the bottom of the assignment popup.
- Bug Fixes:
  - Assignments now have a total sort order (ie when you create a new task, it
    won't switch positions in the list after a reload. this is _very_ minor but
    was bothering me.)

## v0.2.3

    any functionality, but means that it will say "Submit on Google Assignments"
    instead of just "Submit".
- Bug Fixes:
  - Fixes task support being so buggy to the point of being unusable. I rushed
    it out and didn't test it enough, sorry. Tell me if I missed anything!
