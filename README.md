# Orion

_v0.4.5_

This project aims to fix as much of the Hunter website as possible. It does this
through a browser extension. To report problems or request a feature, please
email gavinmorrow (at) hunterschools (dot) org or gavinmorrow.dev@gmail.com.

## Features

- **Custom UI**: Make an actually good assignment center calendar view!!
- **Login automatically**: Automatically press the various "next" buttons when
  you want to log in.
- Automatically deselect "Completed", so you don't need to manually do it (only
  activated when the custom ui is not active).
- Other miscellaneous bug and styling fixes.

support it and I'll do my best. Please note that at the moment, this is only
available for desktop (not mobile).

Safari is also not supported at the moment, although I'm working on it. If you
use Safari (like me), send me an email and I'll prioritize it!
